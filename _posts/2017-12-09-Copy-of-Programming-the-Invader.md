    <td>I had programed the alien boss and the laser but I hadn't done anything on the normal invader yet.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>My target for this lesson was to get most of the invaders programing done.</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>I did reach my target but I still have to finish it off as homework.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I used persevering when I realised that I had just done all of the program on the space ship not the invader and in the process of doing that I lost all of my space invaders programming. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I used questioning when I was trying to re-program the spaceship and it went right fine but when I tried to go left it just went down. I tried to question what I had done wrong and how I could fix it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I always tried to use independence, especially when I had just  deleted half my work, I managed to fix it without asking Mr Keen.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>When I deleted my work I reflected on how I had deleted it and how I could prevent it from happening again.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>When I got it wrong I engaged my brain into fixing it.</td>

    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning would have gone better if I hadn't accidently deleted half of my work. If I hadnâ€™t deleted it then I would be a lot further on than I am at the moment.</td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>

    <td>Next time I will have to be extra careful not to delete all of my work because that took up a lot of the lesson that I could have been doing work in.</td>
