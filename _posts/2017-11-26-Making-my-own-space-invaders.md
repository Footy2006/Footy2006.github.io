    <td>I think that my learning could have gone better if I had tried to pay as much attention to the work that Mr.Keen was doing. If I had done this then I could have been able to do my work a lot quicker so that I could then get back to see what Mr.Keen was doing on his computer and then I would be able to do that as well instead of just getting stuck on one thing for the whole entire lesson.</td>
