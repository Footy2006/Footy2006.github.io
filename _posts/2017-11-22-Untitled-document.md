**My review of 5 retro games**.

**Donkey kong**

Donkey kong is a good game with a simple objective and simple controls. The main three sprites are Donkey kong, Mario and the princess but there's also the crates which are trying to kill you and the ramps (the track). The variables were the score, the high score and the bonus.

**Pacman**

Pac man is a unique game with a simple objective. **Do not get eaten. **The main sprites are Pacman and of course the monsters. Other sprites are the maze and the pickups.

**Space Invaders**

Space Invaders is a very clever but simple game. The objective is to kill all the other ships but not get hit yourself. The sprites are your ship, the enemy ships, your score and your bullets.

**Mario Kart**

Mario kart is a brilliant game. The main sprites are the carts and their drivers, your position and your time. Although it is simple it is probably one of the best games I have ever played.

**Temple Run**

Temple run is a simple game. The objective is **Don't Die! **The main sprites are your character and the track but there are also coins and pick ups.
